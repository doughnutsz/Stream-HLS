# Stream-HLS

![Stream-HLS](framework.png)

Stream-HLS is a novel framework designed to simplify the development of customized hardware circuits for software applications using high-level synthesis (HLS). Traditional HLS approaches often require significant expertise in hardware design and frameworks, making the process non-trivial. Stream-HLS takes PyTorch or C/C++ code and automatically generates a streaming dataflow design in HLS optimized for a target FPGA.

## Key Features

Stream-HLS offers the following features:

- **Automatic Hardware Generation**: Converts C/C++ or PyTorch software code into optimized custom hardware designs and host code for FPGAs.
- **Streaming Dataflow Architectures**: Generates hardware designs consisting of modules that communicate through pure streaming channels when possible or through a mixture of shared buffers and streaming channels.
- **Global Scheduling and Performance Model**: Provides an accurate analytical performance model for global scheduling of streaming dataflow architectures.
- **High Performance**: Evaluated using various HLS benchmarks and real-world benchmarks from convolutional neural networks and transformer models. Stream-HLS designs outperform the designs of prior state-of-the-art automation frameworks and manually-optimized designs of abstraction frameworks by up to 79.43× and 10.62× geometric means respectively.
- **Built on MLIR**: Utilizes the multi-level intermediate representation (MLIR) framework, allowing for future reuse and extensions.

## Installation

### External Tools (Front-end)
#### 1- [Torch-MLIR](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir)
Create a Python virtual environment using `conda` or `pyenv` using `Python 3.11`. Now run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, you can install Torch and Torch-MLIR packages from this [link](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir/releases/tag/snapshot-20240127.1096), and install them using pip.

#### 2- [Polygeist](https://github.com/llvm/Polygeist) (Optional)
Can be installed if the C/C++ front-end is needed.

### Stream-HLS Prerequisites
#### 1- LLVM/MLIR
Clone and build [LLVM/MLIR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/llvmorg-18.1.2) version llvmorg-18.1.2 in extern using the following commands.

```sh
cd build
cmake -G Ninja ../llvm \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=mlir \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_LLD=ON

cmake --build . --target check-mlir
```


#### 2- Ampl and Gurobi Solvers
Install the free version of [Ampl in academia](https://ampl.com/ampl-in-academia/) which is shipped with Gurobi.

### Stream-HLS Installation

After building the MLIR/LLVM project, please run:
```sh
./build-streamhls.sh /path/to/llvm-project
``` 
Or open the build bash script [`build-streamhls.sh`](./build-streamhls.sh) and set path variable manually to point to the llvm-project installed in the previous step.
